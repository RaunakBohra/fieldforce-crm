Subject: Request to Unblock IP Address - Development Testing

Dear MSG91 Support Team,

I am writing to request the unblocking of my IP address that was blocked due to rate limiting during development testing.

Account Details:
- Auth Key: 460963AsJWGjhc68e48e5eP1
- Widget ID: 356a6763534a353431353234
- Email Domain: qtoedo.mailer91.com

Blocked IP Address: 27.34.67.46

Reason for Block:
I was conducting development testing of your OTP widget integration and made multiple test requests in a short period, which triggered your fraud detection system.

Request:
1. Please unblock IP: 27.34.67.46
2. If possible, whitelist this IP for development/testing purposes

I understand the importance of fraud prevention and will ensure to:
- Use test mode when available
- Limit the frequency of test requests
- Implement proper rate limiting in my application

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
