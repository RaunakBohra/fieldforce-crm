## What Are Claude Code Subagents?

### Definition

**Subagents** are specialized, task-specific AI assistants that work alongside Claude Code (the main agent). They:
- Have **independent context windows** (no cross-contamination)
- Can **run in parallel** (multiple agents working simultaneously)
- Are **highly specialized** (code review, security, architecture, etc.)
- Are **production-ready** (100+ community-tested agents available)
- Are **project-aware** (access to your codebase and documentation)

### How They Work

```
You (Developer)
    ↓
Claude Code (Main Agent)
    ↓
    ├─→ Code Reviewer Agent (checks guidelines compliance)
    ├─→ Security Auditor Agent (OWASP checks)
    ├─→ Test Engineer Agent (ensures 70% coverage)
    ├─→ Architecture Agent (portable patterns)
    └─→ Documentation Agent (maintains docs)
```

**Key Concept**: Claude Code **delegates** specialized tasks to expert agents, who return focused results.

# Code Reviewer Agent

## Role
Expert code reviewer enforcing Field Force CRM development guidelines.

## Expertise
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- No `any` types
- Teal/amber color scheme enforcement
- File size limits (controllers: 200-500 lines)
- No emojis (use SVG icons)
- Single Responsibility Principle

## Tasks
1. Review code for guideline compliance
2. Check TypeScript strict mode
3. Verify color scheme (teal/amber only)
4. Ensure no emojis in code
5. Check file size limits
6. Validate error handling

## Output Format
- List violations with line numbers
- Suggest fixes
- Severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
```

### How to Invoke

```bash
# Automatic (Claude Code decides)
"Review my authentication code"

# Explicit (you specify agent)
"Ask the code-reviewer agent to check auth.ts"

# Via Slash Command
/review-code src/routes/auth.ts
```

## Why We Need Subagents for Our Project

### Our Project Complexity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Documentation** | 23,000+ lines across 20+ files |
| **Development Time** | 12 weeks (90 days) |
| **Modules** | Auth, Contacts, Visits, Orders, Payments, Analytics, Offline, i18n, Multi-tenancy |
| **Strict Guidelines** | No `any`, no emojis, teal/amber colors, 70% test coverage |
| **Architecture** | Portable (Cloudflare ↔ AWS), Hexagonal, DI patterns |
| **Tech Stack** | Workers, Hono, Neon, Prisma, React, Tailwind, R2, SES, Queues |

**Problem**: Too much complexity for manual enforcement of standards!

### Current Pain Points (Without Subagents)

❌ **Manual Code Review** - You have to remember all 23,000+ lines of guidelines
❌ **No Automated Checks** - Easy to forget "no emojis" or "teal/amber only"
❌ **Serial Processing** - Build feature → then test → then review (slow!)
❌ **Context Overload** - Main Claude Code tries to do everything at once
❌ **Inconsistent Quality** - Human error in following guidelines

### Solutions (With Subagents)

✅ **Automated Enforcement** - Code reviewer agent checks every guideline automatically
✅ **Parallel Processing** - Review + Test + Build happen simultaneously
✅ **Specialized Context** - Each agent focuses on ONE thing (better quality)
✅ **Consistent Quality** - Agents never forget guidelines
✅ **Faster Development** - 3 weeks → 4 days (proven case study)

| Manual code review | 1 hour | Medium (human error) |
| Write tests | 2 hours | Medium |
| Security check | 30 min | Low (easy to miss) |
| Update docs | 1 hour | Low (often forgotten) |
| **Total** | **8.5 hours** | **Medium** |

### With Subagents (Proposed)

| Activity | Time | Quality | Notes |
|----------|------|---------|-------|
| Implement feature | 4 hours | High | Agent guidance |
| Agent code review | 10 min | High | Automated checks |
| Write tests | 1.5 hours | High | Agent identifies cases |
| Agent security check | 5 min | High | OWASP automated |
| Agent architecture review | 5 min | High | Pattern enforcement |
| Agent doc update | 10 min | High | Automated |
| **Total** | **6 hours** | **High** | **29% faster, higher quality** |

**Time Savings**: 2.5 hours per feature
**Quality Improvement**: Automated enforcement of all 23,000+ lines of guidelines

### ROI Over 12 Weeks

**Week 1-4**: 20 features × 2.5 hours = **50 hours saved**
**Week 5-12**: 40 features × 2.5 hours = **100 hours saved**
**Total**: **150 hours saved = ~4 weeks of development time**

Plus:
- ✅ Higher code quality
- ✅ Fewer bugs
- ✅ Better security
- ✅ Current documentation
- ✅ Consistent architecture

---

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Agent Context Limits
**Problem**: Agents might not have full codebase context
**Solution**: Reference specific docs in agent instructions (e.g., "Read: /docs/02-guidelines/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md")

### Challenge 2: Conflicting Advice
**Problem**: Different agents might suggest conflicting approaches
**Solution**: Establish agent hierarchy (security > architecture > code style)

### Challenge 3: Over-Reliance
**Problem**: Developers might stop thinking critically
**Solution**: Use agents for **enforcement**, not **decision-making**

### Challenge 4: Setup Time
**Problem**: Creating 12 agents takes time
**Solution**: Start with 5 critical agents, expand gradually

### Challenge 5: Learning Curve
**Problem**: Team needs to learn how to use agents
**Solution**: This document serves as training guide

## Comparison with Current Approach

### Current: Single Claude Code Agent

```
You: "Build Day 1 authentication"
    ↓
Claude Code:
- Reads 23,000+ lines of docs
- Builds feature
- Tries to remember all guidelines
- Might miss security check
- Might forget test coverage
- Might miss doc update
    ↓
Result: Good, but prone to oversight
```

### Proposed: Team of Specialized Agents

```
You: "Build Day 1 authentication"
    ↓
Claude Code (Orchestrator):
- Builds feature
    ↓
    ├→ Code Reviewer: Checks guidelines compliance ✅
    ├→ Security Auditor: OWASP checks ✅
    ├→ Test Engineer: Coverage validation ✅
    ├→ Architecture Agent: Pattern compliance ✅
    └→ Documentation Agent: Updates docs ✅
    ↓
Result: Excellent, comprehensive validation
```
